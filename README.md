## Plotting graphs using simple VB code


</div>

### Description

This code is meant for beginners who want to learn how graphs can be plotted using VB code only
 
### More Info
 
Equation of the graph will be required in the form of y-&gt;x

DrawGraph function does all the stuff, you need to call it in an event. Function needs a picturebox (for plotting graph on), a textbox (to enter equation) and script control (provided in the folder, but may need re-referencing, just browse it as ActiveX)

Calculates values of Y based on similated values, which are converted to co-ordinates and then plotted

SpeedMark variable is used to set the quality and speed of plotting. If set too high, the program might appear as if it is hung.
